PLaylists manager TODOs
=============

Nice-to-Have
------------

- Script to convert flac to mp3 (install lame if not done)
      => lame -V0 --vbr-new infile outfile
- Script to dowsample flac and convert to mp3 (from Apollo's Adele 21):
    sox lossless-24bit.flac -G -b 16 lossless-16bit.flac rate -v -L 44100 dither
    avconv -i losless-16bit.flac -codec:a libmp3lame -q:a 0 output.mp3
    Maybe use  Sox option -S


    sox --i <filename>
    to produce output such as:

    Input File : 'final.flac'
    Channels : 4
    Sample Rate : 44100
    Precision : 16-bit
    Duration : 00:00:11.48 = 506179 samples = 860.849 CDDA sectors
    File Size : 2.44M
    Bit Rate : 1.70M
    Sample Encoding: 16-bit FLAC
    Comment : 'Comment=Processed by SoX'


- Script to check songs only in flac format and convert them to mp3 in order to include in playlists
- createNASPlaylistFromItunesPlaylist => to handle also flac files


Future

Probably Bad Ideas
------------------

- Script to convert flac to apple lossless => NOT needed with iOS11. They support flac now.
